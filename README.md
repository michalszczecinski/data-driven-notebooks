## Idea

This is a quest to go back to basics and establish strong knowledge on fundamental concepts (from mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, engineering, economics, etc.).

Why?

1. **New perspective** - it has been a long since I studied those topics systematically at a school or university. Then I had a very different body of experiences and knowledge. Nowadays, when I go back to those fundamental concepts, I often get a new realization or a way of thinking about them. This happens through referring to situations I came across, practical applications I have seen, or tapping into a more extensive network of concepts I have learned about.

2. **Intuition** - often, we use things without complete intuitive understanding but instead rely on memorization or referencing to standard tools and sources.  This might limit our problem-solving and creativity or even make us forget to consider essential assumptions. Understanding is better than memorization.

  How would you derive that method or formula if you would not know it? (eg. the equation for the sum of arithmetic series, formula for combinations, trigonometric functions, standard deviation, statistical tests, etc..) 

3. **Strong foundations** - in most technical disciplines, learning is sequential; for example, in Mathematics, knowledge is like a complex structure we build on top of layer by layer (you can imagine an inverted pyramid). Misunderstanding or gaps in a particular area can hinder learning in the following areas. In practice, this means I am ** optimizing for coverage vs. efficiency. It might seem like a waste of time for many people since, by design, it has a lot of duplication and overlaps with things I know or at least have learned about before.       

4. **Interactivity** - it attempts to break the `learning-forgetting-relearning` loop by building strong intuition and deeper fundamental understanding through playing with concepts interactively (implementation, simulation, visual examples, exciting/practical problems). That is the reason why the default format of my notes is Python Notebook (Colab)**.  

5. **Modularity** - by making learning concepts as modular as possible, we can then visualize connections between them, and incrementally improve and expand the knowledge network.

## Guidelines 

1. Notebook should cover specific chunk of knowledge.
2. Notebook should be serve as a memorable and useful reference for a concept.
3. Notebook should include interactive elements.
4. Notebook should include important definitions and interesting examples.
