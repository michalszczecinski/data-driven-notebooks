## Key Problems

Description of key problems that can be solved using the content of this subject. It can include canonical problems found in the course chapters plus highlighted problems discussed in various online lectures/youtube videos.

It is useful to highlight the problems that are common on the Polytechnic exam papers, which should reflect the key concepts that students are expected to know and are tested on. The goal of this is not to optimise studying for the exam (it is being done after exams) but rather to use a systematic method for identifying the concepts that regularly show up in the papers and are being tested, which should be a good proxy of how important those concepts are for students to know, and hopefully how useful those skills are in real life. This should serve as a good reminder of the most important skills and concepts to refer to.

Where possible (if time permits) I will try to create relevant notebooks and link to them.
