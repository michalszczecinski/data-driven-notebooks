## Prefixes

Prefix of the notebook would start with category with exception of special prefixes.

### Special prefixes

`books_` - Notebooks summarising books. Each notebook should cover one book. Notebook notes can start very small and be incrementally added.
Where book is particularly rich in technical details, I might include the content in separate notebooks under the folder for the area it belongs to.

It includes:
* high level summary of the book and why is it useful
* definitions and facts I want to remember
* technical aspects that I want to build knowledge of through inclusion of data or interactive visualization/simulation
