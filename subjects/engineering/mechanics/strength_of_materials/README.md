# Strength of Materials

`Strength of Materials` (also called Mechanics of Materials) is a foundational course in engineering, that is the basis of machine design.


1. Foundational subject in `Engineering Mechanics`
    * statics
    * dynamics
    * kinematics
    * and strength of materials.
2. Shows up in everything we do in mechanical engineering
     * machine design
     * manufacturing
     * thermal design
3. Used whenever we need to physically touch something, helps with
     * failure analysis
     * understanding how things are set up for loading
     * gearing
     * mechanical components
4. Fundamental area of study investigating concepts needed during the design process
     * mechanical principles of materials and how those materials will impact the mechanical design 
     * how material will operate under certain conditions
     * how to select a material for a certain design requirements
     * how to avoid a catastrophic failure

## Objectives

1. To understand how to analyse stresses and strains in a structure or machine.
2. To be able to select materials based on how the various mechanical properties fit to an application. 
3. To perform a stress analysis and calculate a design factor.
4. Create a design based on a given design requirements.
