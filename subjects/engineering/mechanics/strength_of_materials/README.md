# Strength of Materials

`Strength of Materials` (also called Mechanics of Materials) is a foundational course in engineering, that is the basis of machine design.


1. Foundational subject in `Engineering Mechanics`
    * statics
    * dynamics
    * kinematics
    * and strength of materials.
2. Shows up in everything we do in mechanical engineering
     * machine design
     * manufacturing
     * thermal design
3. Used whenever we need to physically touch something, helps with
     * failure analysis
     * understanding how things are set up for loading
     * gearing
     * mechanical components
4. Fundamental area of study investigating concepts needed during the design process
     * mechanical principles of materials and how those materials will impact the mechanical design 
     * how material will operate under certain conditions
     * how to select a material for a certain design requirements
     * how to avoid a catastrophic failure

## Objectives

1. To understand how to analyse stresses and strains in a structure or machine.
2. To be able to select materials based on how the various mechanical properties fit to an application. 
3. To perform a stress analysis and calculate a design factor.
4. Create a design based on a given design requirements.

## Topics
List of chapters covered in the Strength of Materials course for Mechatronics Engineering at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

1. Simple Stress and Strain
2. Torsion
3. Shear Force and Bending Moment
4. Stresses in Beams
5. Combined Stresses
6. Experimental Stress Analysis

## Key Problems

Description of key problems that can be solved using the content of this course.
It includes canonical problems found in the chapters plus highlighted problems came across in online lectures/youtube videos.

Also should highlight the problems that are common on the exam paper at Polytechnic, which reflect the key concepts that students are expected to know and are tested on. Where possible (if time permits) will try to create relevant notebook and link to it. 


1. Calculate axial strain knowing forces, dimension and material properties.
2. Calculate axial deformation due to thermal expansion knowing temperature, dimension and material properties.
3. Calculate the angle of twist knowing the applied torque, dimensions and material properties.

<!-- 3. Calculate the maximum stress in a beam knowing the applied load, dimensions and material properties. -->
