## Key Problems

Description of key problems that can be solved using the content of this subject.
It can include canonical problems found in the course chapters plus highlighted problems discussed in various online lectures/youtube videos.

It is useful to highlight the problems that are common on the Polytechnic exam papers, which should reflect the key concepts that students are expected to know and are tested on. The goal of this is not to optimise studying for the exam (it is being done after exams) but rather to use a systematic method for identifying the concepts that regularly show up in the papers and are being tested, which should be a good proxy of how important those concepts are for students to know, and hopefully how useful those skills are in real life. This should serve as a good reminder of the most important skills and concepts to refer to.

Where possible (if time permits) I will try to create relevant notebooks and link to them. 

### Exam problems (summary)

1. Belt drive
Scenario: Visual inspection system used to inspect products that are brought in by a conveyor belt system powered by an electric motor.
To determine (summary): given the data of the system (mass of the conveyor belt, mass of the product, friction coefficient, etc), determine the torque requirements of the motor to drive the system.
Purpose: This should help us to choose right motor for the application and specifiations we want to perform.

Examples of common questions from past exam papers:

A. 2022 August exam papers

(a) the acceleration torque of the system referred to the motor
(b) the peak torque and power requirement of the motor

B. 2018 February exam paper

(a) the total torque of the motor when the system is running at maximum constant velocity
(b) the maximum power requirement of the motor during acceleration.

C. 2017 August exam paper

(a)   the load torque  to  overcome  the weight of the conveyor belt and  work piece, the gas jet force, and the friction at the guide
(b)   the acceleration torque requirement of the motor to accelerate the system.

D. 2017 February exam paper

(a)   the load torque,  reflected at the motor axis, to overcome the weight of the conveyor belt and product, the brushing force, and the friction at the guide.
(b)   the acceleration torque requirement of the motor to accelerate the system.
