# Books
Notebooks summarising books. Each notebook should cover one book. Notebook notes can start very small and be incrementally added.
Focus is mostly on books related to technology and engineering where I want to remember certain aspects.
Where book is particularly rich in technical details, I might include the content in separate notebooks under the folder for the area it belongs to.

It includes:
- definitions and facts I want to remember
- interactive aspects that I want to better understand through visualization or simulation
